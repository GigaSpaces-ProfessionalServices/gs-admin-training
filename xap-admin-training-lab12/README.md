# GigaSpaces Admin API 

## Lab Goals

**1.** Explore about the Admin APIâ€™s capabilities <br />
**2.** Learn to capture the alerts using the Admin APIs<br />

## Lab Description
In this lab we will focus on GigaSpaces Admin API.<br>
To better know its capabilities you will use GigaSpaces Admin API for your convenience.
In the lab we change default of service limit 1 in order to allow deployment of more than one instance in the same GSC
We run a feeder to fill up data, and run relocate in order to start a new GSC to allow more memory per each instance
We also run monitor script that show us various alerts related to CPU & memory utilization and instances

### 1	Start gs-agent

1.1 Navigate to $XAP_HOME/bin <br />
        
1.2 Start run the following:

    ./gs.sh host run-agent --auto
    ./gs.sh container create --vm-option -Dcom.gigaspaces.grid.gsc.serviceLimit=2 --memory 100m --count 2 localhost
    ./gs.sh space deploy --partitions 2 --ha demo

1.3 Edit gs-home/config/alerts/alerts.xml reduce memory(HeapMemoryUtilizationAlertConfiguration) and cpu(CpuUtilizationAlertConfiguration) thresholds 
1.4 Edit runFeeder, runMonitor, runRelocate scripts set installation home dir and lookupgroup.
1.5 See deployment distribution in web-ui (2 containers each having 2 instances)
1.6 Run the following scripts:
    build
    runMonitor
    runRelocate
    runFeeder
1.7 Follow console of the scripts, See deployment distribution in web-ui 
####  Relocate 
1.1 The Admin script will test the runtime 20 times (then the scripts exits)<br />
1.2 Looking for GSC were UsedHeapSize is more than 50MB <br />
1.3 If such GSC exits it checks if there are more than one PU instance deployed on that GSC.<br />
1.4 If such GSC is found the script looks for an empty GSC to relocate one of the Pu instances to.<br />
1.5 If it founds an empty GSC then  a PU instance will be relocated to that GSC else a new GSC will be started with AdminApiZone in zones & then the  PU instance will be relocated.<br />
1.6 The same repeated till each GSC contains only one PU instance.<br />
1.7 Between each check the script sleeps for 20 seconds.<br />
 
#### 2 Alert 
2.1 Terminate one of the GSC from the webui.<br />
2.2 Watch the alerts in the command console where you activated the script.<br />
