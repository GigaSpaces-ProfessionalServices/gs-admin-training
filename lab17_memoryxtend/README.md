# The Bill Buddy Application with MemoryXtend

## Lab Goals

1. Experience an application deployment process.
2. Get familiar with the BillBuddy application.
3. Use GigaSpaces MemoryXtend. 

## Lab Description
You will understand MemoryXtend and its benefits by deploying a GigaSpaces application.

#### 1	Start gs-agent

 1. Navigate to `$GS_HOME/bin`
        
 2. Start **gs-agent** with a local Manager server and 5 GSCs:
```
./gs.sh host run-agent --auto --gsc=5
```
    
#### 2	Deploy BillBuddy_Space
    
1. Open `$GS_ADMIN_TRAINING_HOME/lab17-memoryxtend` project with Intellij (open the pom.xml).
2. Run mvn install
```
    ~/gs-admin-training/lab17-gs_admin_training$ mvn package

```
3. IntelliJ path Variables (under preferences)

###### Add GS_LOOKUP_GROUPS & GS_LOOKUP_LOCATORS

For example set `GS_LOOKUP_LOCATORS=localhost` and `GS_LOOKUP_GROUPS=xap-17.1.2`

4. Copy the runConfigurations directory to the Intellij **.idea** directory to enable the Java Application configurations. Restart Intellij.

5. Open a new Terminal and navigate to `$GS_HOME/bin`
```
cd $GS_HOME/bin
```
6. Use the gs CLI to deploy the BillBuddy_Space:
``` 
./gs.sh pu deploy BillBuddySpace ~/gs-admin-training/lab17-memoryxtend/BillBuddy_Space/target/BillBuddy_Space.jar 
```
#### 3 Run BillBuddyAccountFeeder from Intellij

1. From Intellij select the BillBuddyAccountFeeder configuration and run it.

###### This application writes Users, Merchants and Contracts to the Space
 
2. Validate Users and Merchants were written to the space using the web Management Console (localhost:8099).  
Go to: Spaces Tab -> Data Types.

4. Query the list of Users by executing the following SQL:
Click the Data Type Name and the sql will be created for you:
```
SELECT * FROM com.gs.billbuddy.model.User WHERE rownum<5000
```
###### Note: Fully qualified class name is required.

#### 4	Run BillBuddyPaymentFeeder project
 * The BillBuddyPaymentFeeder application creates payments by randomly choosing a user, a merchant and an amount and performs the initial process of a payment.
 * This includes deposit and withdrawal updates of each partyâ€™s balance appropriately.
 * After the payment is initially processed it is written to the space for further processing.
 * A new Payment is created every second.
 
1. Run the BillBuddyPaymentFeeder using Intellij:  
Use the same instructions as used for the BillBuddyAccountFeeder.

2. Validate Payments were written to the space.  
Click the Payment Data Type Name as you did in section 3.3
 
3. Go to the statistics operations and see that a payment is actually added every second.

## 5 Deploy BillBuddyWebApplication project

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to GigaSpaces install directory/bin/.
2. Use the gs CLI to deploy BillBuddyWebApplication
``` 
./gs.sh pu deploy BillBuddyWebApplication ~/gs-admin-training/lab17-memoryxtend/BillBuddyWebApplication/target/BillBuddyWebApplication.war
```
3. Validate the application is deployed.

4. Use the url to provision the BillBuddy web tool:  
   `http://localhost:8080/BillBuddyWebApplication`

#### 6 Undeploy the application 

 * Undeploy the space:  
   `./gs.sh pu undeploy BillBuddySpace`

#### 7 Deploy the space and verify that all records were restored from SSD.
```
./gs.sh pu deploy BillBuddySpace ~/gs-admin-training/lab17-memoryxtend/BillBuddy_Space/target/BillBuddy_Space.jar
```
Go to the new UI (new Ops manager) and see that all records were restored from the SSD back to the space.
